# **Deep Learning Dynamics: Harnessing LSTMs and Transformers for S&P 500 Stock Predictions**

**Introduction**

In this project, we aim to predict stock prices using deep learning techniques. We will utilize a dataset containing historical stock prices of companies in the S&P 500 index. The main objectives are to explore different deep learning architectures, including LSTMs and transformers, and compare their performance in predicting stock prices. Additionally, we will implement an ensemble method that combines the predictions of the LSTM and transformer models to potentially improve the overall prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we will provide a user-friendly interface for selecting a stock and retrieving daily predictions.

***Data Loading and Preprocessing***

First, let's load the all_stocks_5yr.csv dataset from Kagglel and perform some initial data preprocessing.
See the link below to download the data:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500?resource=download&select=all_stocks_5yr.csv

We load the dataset using pandas, convert the 'date' column to datetime type, and sort the dataframe by date in ascending order. We remove any rows with missing values to ensure data consistency. Then, we normalize the numerical features using MinMaxScaler from the sklearn.preprocessing module. Finally, we create a new dataframe scaled_df with the scaled data, along with the 'date' and 'Name' columns.

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('all_stocks_5yr.csv')

# Convert the 'date' column to datetime type
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Sort the dataframe by 'date' in ascending order
df = df.sort_values('date')

# Remove any rows with missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']])

# Create a new dataframe with the scaled data
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns=['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'], index=df.index)

***Data Preparation for Deep Learning Models***

Let's prepare the data for input into our deep learning models.

We define a create_sequences function that takes the stock data and a lookback parameter as input. It creates sequences of input features (X) and corresponding target values (y) based on the specified lookback period. We select a specific stock (e.g., 'AAPL') for demonstration purposes and create sequences with a lookback of 60 days. Finally, we split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
"""

def create_sequences(data, lookback):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - lookback):
        X.append(data[i:(i + lookback), :])  # Include all features
        y.append(data[i + lookback, 3])  # Using 'close' price as the target
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Select a specific stock for demonstration
stock_name = 'AAPL'
stock_data = scaled_df[scaled_df['Name'] == stock_name]

# Create sequences with a lookback of 60 days
lookback = 60
X, y = create_sequences(stock_data[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']].values, lookback)

# Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.7)
val_size = int(len(X) * 0.15)
X_train, y_train = X[:train_size], y[:train_size]
X_val, y_val = X[train_size:train_size+val_size], y[train_size:train_size+val_size]
X_test, y_test = X[train_size+val_size:], y[train_size+val_size:]

# Prepare the data for prediction
latest_data = stock_data[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']].values[-lookback:]
latest_data = latest_data.reshape(1, lookback, 5)

"""***Building and Training Deep Learning Models***

Now, let's implement and train different deep learning models for stock price prediction.

**1 LSTM Model**

Here, we will create an LSTM model using the Keras Sequential API. The model consists of an LSTM layer with 64 units, followed by a Dense layer for output. We compile the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss. Finally, we train the model on the training data for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32 and evaluate its performance on the testing data.
"""

# Create an LSTM model
lstm_model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(lookback, 5)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
lstm_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
lstm_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

"""**2 Transformer Model**

Here, we implement a custom transformer model using the Keras framework. The transformer model consists of an initial convolution layer to project the input to the model dimension, followed by multiple transformer blocks. Each transformer block includes layer normalization, multi-head attention, and a feed-forward neural network. The output of the transformer blocks is then passed through a global average pooling layer and a final dense layer for output. We compile the model using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 and MSE loss. We train the model with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

"""The build_time_series_transformer function takes the following hyperparameters:

*   sequence_length: The number of days in the lookback window.
*   num_features: The number of features (e.g., open, high, low, close, volume).
*   num_heads: The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention layer.
*   d_model: The dimension of the model.
*   num_layers: The number of transformer layer

The model architecture is as follows.

1.  Input layer: Accepts input sequences of shape (sequence_length, num_features).
2.  Initial convolution layer: Projects the input to the model dimension using a 1D convolution with ReLU activation.
3.  Transformer blocks: Consists of layer normalization, multi-head attention, and a feed-forward neural network. The number of transformer blocks is determined by num_layers
4.  Global average pooling: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the transformer output.
4.  Final dense layer: Produces the output prediction.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 1e-5, and mean squared error (MSE) loss. Early stopping is used during training to prevent overfitting, with patience set to 3 epochs.

The data preprocessing steps remain the same as before, including scaling the features using MinMaxScaler and creating sequences with a lookback of 60 days. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the fit method with the specified hyperparameters.

The LSTM model predicted close price of 0.0760 while ctual close price is 0.07486 which is quite close but the Transformer model predicted a close price of 0.0360 indicating we still need to work on the transformer model 😲 ✅

**Conclusion and Future Enhancements**

In this project, we successfully implemented and compared LSTM and Transformer models for stock price prediction, enhanced with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) feature. We conducted a thorough analysis of the models' performance using various metrics and evaluation techniques.

Our findings indicate that the LSTM model demonstrated better performance compared to the Transformer model. The LSTM model achieved lower mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), and a higher R-squared (R^2) value, suggesting a better fit to the data. The LSTM model also had faster training times and lower complexity in terms of the number of parameters.

We evaluated the directional accuracy of the models, which measures their ability to correctly predict the direction of stock price movements. Both models demonstrated decent directional accuracy, with the LSTM model slightly outperforming the Transformer model.

To enhance the models' performance, we incorporated the Simple Moving Average (SMA) feature and experimented with different architectures and hyperparameters. The enhanced LSTM model showed improved performance metrics compared to the initial LSTM model, while the enhanced Transformer model also exhibited better results, although not as significant as the LSTM model.

We implemented an ensemble method by averaging the predictions of the LSTM and Transformer models. However, the ensemble model's performance was negatively impacted by the Transformer model's lower accuracy, resulting in a negative R-squared value.

In the user prompt section, we provided a user-friendly interface for selecting a stock and retrieving daily predictions. When tested with the stock symbol "SPG," the LSTM model predicted a close price of 0.0760, which was quite close to the actual close price of 0.07486. On the other hand, the Transformer model predicted a close price of 0.0360, indicating that further improvements are needed for the Transformer model.

Future enhancements for this project could include:

1. Incorporating additional relevant features and technical indicators to capture more complex patterns and improve the models' predictive power.
2. Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the Transformer model's performance.
3. Exploring advanced ensemble techniques, such as weighted averaging or stacking, to effectively combine the strengths of multiple models.
4. Incorporating market sentiment analysis and news data to capture the impact of external factors on stock prices.
5. Expanding the scope of the project to include multiple stock markets and longer time horizons.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning models, particularly LSTM, for stock price prediction. While the LSTM model showed promising results, there is still room for improvement, especially for the Transformer model. By continuously refining the models, incorporating additional features, and leveraging advanced techniques, we can strive towards more accurate and reliable stock price predictions to aid in investment decision-making.
